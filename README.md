## Description
A PoA(proof of attendance system) built on the XRP ledger has the potential to provide an easy and secure way to verify attendance at a wide range of events and activities happening in real life or online. Few potential uses for it are: 

⚫University students can use the system to quickly verify attendance at lectures, seminars or other educational events. 

⚫Large events like conferences etc where it can be difficult to keep track of who has attended and who didn't. 

⚫Verifying employee showing up at meetings, training sessions etc.
